License Analysis

MIT License
- Extremely permissive and simple to understand
- Allows commercial use, modification, and distribution with minimal requirements
- Only requires including the original copyright notice and disclaimers
- Chosen for this this code due to its simplicity and flexibility

Apache License 2.0
- More structured than MIT but still permissive
- Includes explicit patent rights protection
- Requires detailed documentation of modifications
- Too heavyweight for this relatively simple implementation

GNU GPL v2
- Strong copyleft license requiring derivative works to use the same license
- Ensures source code remains open and freely available
- Requires distribution of complete source code
- Too restrictive for a utility library that others might want to incorporate into various projects
